# Modal PopUp with React.js
Modals popup windows are very popular for capturing user information, such as emails. There are plenty of websites that utilize this to build their email list or collect leads for their newsletter or product.

If you have purchased something online from an e-commerce website, then you've most likely encountered a popup offering you a discount or special offer. There are plenty of ways to utilize popup modals in your website,

I used React Hooks and styled components to create this modal. You can using regular CSS or any method to style the modal.

In order to get started, simply create a React app in your terminal

```
npx create-react-app react-modal
```
Then, you can cd into your project.


```
cd react-modal
```
If you are using VS code and have the auto open set up, then you can type this to automatically open your code editor


```
code .
```

Now you're ready to start coding.
